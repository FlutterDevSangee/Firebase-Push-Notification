Firebase is a popular mobile and web application development platform, and Flutter is a versatile framework for building cross-platform mobile apps. By combining Firebase and Flutter, you can enable push notifications in your app, allowing you to send real-time alerts, updates, or messages to users, even when the app is not actively open.
